you access http://whereveryourproxyis:4180 ,
oauth2-proxy redirects https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/oauth2/start checks if there is authenticated session and if not
redirects further to login-url https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/dex/auth
then Dex should authenticate user ( prompt with form to enter username and password )
after successful authentication on Dex will send data to /oauth2/callback so that oauth2-proxy can retrieve token from Dex ( this actually happens through the browser but never mind)
when ouath2-proxy successfully retrieves token it should present content from upstream localhost:8080
